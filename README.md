# Bitvector KZG Commitment From PLONK Advice Column

This repository uses the PLONK proving system to commit to an advice column representing a bit vector in KZG form. It can be used to prove the provenance of values for MPC Laconic OT, as described in the [Extractable Witness Encryption for ZKG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/264.pdf).
